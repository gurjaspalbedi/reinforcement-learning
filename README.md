# Reinforcement Learning
This repository is for learning and experiments for "Reinforcement Learning" algorithms

Following algortihms were implemented and details of each algorithm is in the README file of each algorithm folder.

1. [Greedy-Epsilon](https://github.com/gurjaspalbedi/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/Greedy-Epsilon)

2. [Optimistic-Greedy](https://github.com/gurjaspalbedi/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/Optimistic-Greedy)

3. [Upper Confidence Bound](https://github.com/gurjaspalbedi/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/upper-confidence-bound)
4. [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/gurjaspalbedi/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/tic-tac-toe)
